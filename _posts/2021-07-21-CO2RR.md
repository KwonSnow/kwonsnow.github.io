# Technoeconomic analysis
[What would it take for renewably powered electrosynthesis to displace petrochemical processes?](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav3506) 
  * Among carbon-based commodity chemicals, ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) has the largest global market size at $230 B and the highest impact on emission reduction, potentially reducing 862 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> per year. (Ethanol: $75 B, 546 Mt)
  * Catalysts should last for thousands of hours of continuous operation.
  * Renewable electricity cost should fall below 4 cents/kWh.
  * Energy conversion efficiency should reach to at least 60 %.  
[A Gross-Margin Model for Defining Technoeconomic Benchmarks in the Electroreduction of CO2](https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201600394)  
  * CO2 reduction catalysts need to be improved so that they last for thousands of hours.
  * Minimum operating current density for CO production: ~ 140 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for Ag, ~ 210 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for Au.
