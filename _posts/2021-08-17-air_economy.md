* Currently 100,000 <b>MOFs</b> structures are known. The pore diameter range from 5 Å to 100 Å. Ultra-high surface area of up to 7,000 m<sup>2</sup>/g
* Captureing CO2 from air requires new materials capable of trapping carbon dioxide at 400-ppm levels.
* Zeolite (0.25 ~ 1.4 mmol/g<sub>CO2</sub>) requires very high regeneration T. Polymers (very low capacity), silica (0.1 ~ 1.8 mmol/g<sub>CO2</sub>), MOFs (0.1 to 4 mmol/g<sub>CO2</sub>) should be functionalized with primary amines to capture CO2. No MOF which can be recycled over a large number of cycles is yet to be reported.
* The current estimate of CO2 capture for direct air capture (DAC) systems spans a range of $100 ~ $1000/tCO<sub>2</sub> while flue gas capture techniques can produce $70 ~ $100/tCO<sub>2</sub>
* Effective electro-catalysis coupled with high-efficiency stateof-the-art solar junctions can already deliver green hydrogen at [~30% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13237).
* Water harvesting from air is already commercialized by [Water Harvesting Inc](http://www.wahainc.com/). Their latest device employs only 200 g of MOF and can harvest water at the rate of 40 L per kilogram of MOF per day. The lifetime of MOF is 6 years. MOF can be treated with strong acid to dissociate the linker from the metal and resynthesized in water.
