Ordinary differential equation (ODE): an equation that contains one or several derivatives of __an__ unknown function.
Partial differential equations (PDEs): differential equations that involve partial derivaties of an unknown functino of __two or more variables__.

order n: nth derivative of the unknown function y is the highest derivative of y in the equation  

implicit form: F(x,y,y') = 0
explicit form: y' = f(x,y)
