The tetrahedron method with Bl√∂chl corrections (ISMEAR=-5) gives a good account of the electronic density of states (DOS). The only drawback is that the method is __not variational with respect to the partial occupancies__. Therefore the calculated forces and the stress tensor can be wrong by up to 5 to 10% for metals. Only for semiconductors and insulators, the forces are correct because the partial occupancies do not vary and are either zero or one. 

## Tables

| ISMEAR | Relaxation | Single point |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Metal   | 1 or 2   | -5   |
| Semiconductor   | -5   | -5   |
| Insulator   | -5   | -5   |
| Unknown   | 0   | -5   |
